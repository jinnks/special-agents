      Exciting! Japan is an incredible destination. Let me help you plan this trip.

      First, a few quick questions to personalize your itinerary:
      1. What time of year are you planning to visit?
      2. Are you interested in: traditional culture, modern cities, nature, food culture, or a mix?
      3. Have you been to Japan before?

      Based on your $3000 budget for one week (excluding flights), I'd estimate:
      - Accommodation: $700-900 (budget hotels/hostels)
      - Food: $700-900 ($50-65 per person per day)
      - Transportation: $300-400 (JR Pass + local transit)
      - Activities/Entry fees: $400-500
      - Shopping/Misc: $400-500

      This gives you a comfortable mid-range experience. I can adjust based on your preferences!
