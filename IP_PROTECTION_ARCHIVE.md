## 📝 Post Content (Establishing Prior Art)

### Key Claims of Origination:

**Opening Statement:**
> "I had an idea: What if AI agents could be packaged and distributed like npm packages? Portable, versionable, and platform-independent."

**Creation Statement:**
> "So I created the .sagent package format - a standardized way to package AI agents."

**Specification:**
> "A ZIP file containing YAML config, system prompts, examples, and knowledge bases. Portable across any LLM platform that supports it. Versionable with semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc.)"

**Implementation:**
> "I've also built a reference implementation - a marketplace prototype where you can upload .sagent packages and chat with agents in real-time."

**Attribution:**
> "I'm a 25-year SRE/software engineer who designed the architecture and .sagent specification, but Claude wrote all the implementation code."
