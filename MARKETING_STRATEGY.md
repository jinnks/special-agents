I built an open-source AI agents marketplace with a unique package format

After seeing how fragmented AI agent distribution is (OpenAI GPTs locked-in, LangChain too technical), I built Special Agents - an ethical marketplace where anyone can create, share, and monetize specialized AI agents.

Key innovations:
• First standardized .sagent package format (like npm for AI agents)
• Built-in ethical review system
• Real-time chat with Claude API
• Simple for non-programmers, powerful for developers

Tech stack: Flask + gevent, Anthropic Claude, SQLAlchemy

Looking for contributors! Whether you're a Python dev, AI researcher, or designer - there's work for everyone.

#### HackerNews
**Title:** "Special Agents – Open-source AI marketplace with industry-first package format"

**Post:**
```
We've built an ethical AI agents marketplace that solves a real problem: there's no standard way to package and distribute AI agents.

The .sagent format is like npm for AI - a ZIP with YAML config, system prompts, examples, and knowledge bases. Portable, versionable, and works anywhere.

Built with Flask + gevent for performance, Claude API for agents, and designed ethically from day one (all agents reviewed).

Looking for feedback and contributors!

🚀 Launching Special Agents - the open-source AI marketplace with a twist

🧵 1/8

We've created the industry's first standardized package format for AI agents (.sagent)

Why? Because right now:
❌ OpenAI GPTs are platform-locked
❌ LangChain requires coding
❌ No portability between platforms

✅ .sagent packages work anywhere

2/8 What's in a .sagent package?

📦 agent.yaml - metadata, pricing, config
🤖 system_prompt.txt - AI instructions
💬 examples/ - sample conversations
📚 knowledge/ - reference materials
📖 README.md - documentation

It's like npm, but for AI agents

3/8 Built with:
• Python + Flask + gevent
• Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet
• SQLAlchemy
• Simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend

Designed for performance and ethical AI from day one

4/8 Ethical-first approach:
✅ All agents reviewed before listing
✅ Safety scoring
✅ Privacy-preserving
✅ No harmful use cases
✅ Transparent about capabilities

We believe AI should help humanity, not harm it

5/8 For Developers:
🔓 Fully open source (MIT)
📝 Clear documentation
🎯 Good first issues tagged
🤝 Welcoming community
💡 Innovative tech stack

Perfect for learning Flask, AI APIs, or just building cool stuff

6/8 For AI Enthusiasts:
🛍️ Browse specialized agents
💬 Chat with AI experts
🎨 Create your own agents
📦 Share with the world

No coding required for basic agents!

7/8 We need YOUR help:
• Python developers
• Frontend designers
• AI researchers
• Technical writers
• Community managers
• Testers

Every contribution matters! 🙌
