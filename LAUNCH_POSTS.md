### Title:
```
Show HN: Special Agents – AI marketplace with equity for contributors (CTO wanted, 20%)
```

### Post Content:
```
I've built Special Agents - an AI agents marketplace with the industry's first standardized package format (.sagent).

The Problem:
• OpenAI GPTs are platform-locked
• LangChain requires heavy coding
• No standard format for AI agent distribution
• Creators can't monetize easily

The Solution - .sagent Package Format:
Think "npm for AI agents" - a ZIP with YAML config, system prompts, examples, and knowledge bases. Portable, versionable, works anywhere.

Current State:
✅ Working prototype (Flask + gevent + Claude API)
✅ Package validation system
✅ Real-time chat interface
✅ MIT licensed, fully open source
✅ Comprehensive documentation

Business Model:
💰 30% commission on agent sales
💰 $29-199/month seller subscriptions
💰 B2B white-label licensing
Target: $1M ARR in 18 months

Looking For:
🎯 CTO/Technical Co-Founder - 20% equity
🎯 Payment Systems Engineer - 2% equity + revenue share
🎯 Security Engineer - 2% equity
🎯 Senior Python developers - 1-2% equity

Why Join:
• Ground floor of new market (AI agents marketplace)
• Meaningful equity (not 0.1%)
• Revenue share on features you build
• Full technical autonomy
• Remote, flexible
• Real exit potential

Tech Stack:
Python 3.12 + Flask 3.0 + gevent (async) + Claude 3.5 Sonnet + SQLAlchemy

Tech Decisions Needed:
1. PostgreSQL vs MySQL for production?
2. Redis vs Memcached for caching?
3. Kubernetes deployment strategy?
4. Best practices for multi-tenant architecture?

This could be the "App Store for AI" - early contributors get life-changing equity.

Open to partnerships, technical discussions, and co-founder conversations.

### Title:
```
Building profitable AI marketplace - 30% commission model, offering 20% equity for CTO
```

### Post Content:
```
**The Opportunity:**

I've built Special Agents - a marketplace where developers create and sell specialized AI agents. Think App Store, but for AI.

**The Innovation:**

Created the first standardized package format for AI agents (.sagent). Currently, AI agents are platform-locked (OpenAI GPTs) or require heavy coding (LangChain). Our format solves portability.

**Current Traction:**

✅ Working MVP
✅ Open source (100+ GitHub stars growing)
✅ Complete technical infrastructure
✅ Clear path to revenue

**Business Model:**

💰 30% commission on all agent sales
💰 Subscription tiers ($29-199/month)
💰 B2B licensing ($999/month)

**Financial Projections:**

Conservative:
• Month 3: $2K MRR
• Month 6: $10K MRR
• Year 1: $150K revenue

Aggressive:
• Month 3: $5K MRR
• Month 6: $20K MRR
• Year 1: $400K revenue

**What I'm Offering:**

Looking for technical co-founder:
• 20% equity (4-year vest)
• CTO title and full technical control
• Revenue share on features
• Remote, flexible hours

Also recruiting:
• Senior developers (1-2% equity each)
• Security expert (2% equity)
• Payment systems engineer (2% + revenue share)

**Why This Will Work:**

1. Real problem (no standard for AI agents)
2. Unique solution (.sagent format)
3. First-mover advantage
4. Ethical focus (market differentiator)
5. Clear monetization
6. Growing AI market

**What I Need:**

• Technical co-founder who can scale this
• Developers who want equity, not salary
• People who see the AI marketplace opportunity

**Tech Stack:**

Python, Flask, gevent, Anthropic Claude API, SQLAlchemy

**Risks:**

• New market (could fail)
• Competition (OpenAI, others)
• Regulatory (AI safety)
• Technical scaling challenges

But early team gets meaningful equity in potentially huge market.

**Next Steps:**

Launching payments next week
First revenue target: 30 days
$10K MRR target: 6 months

Who wants to build this with me?

### Subject:
```
CTO opportunity - AI marketplace (20% equity)
```

### Body:
```
Hi [Name],

I came across your work on [specific project] and was impressed by [specific technical achievement].

I'm building Special Agents - an AI agents marketplace with an industry-first package format. We've created the .sagent format (think npm for AI) to solve the AI agent portability problem.

Current state:
✅ Working MVP with real users
✅ Open source, growing community
✅ Clear path to $1M ARR

I'm looking for a technical co-founder to scale this from MVP to profitable business.

What I'm offering:
• 20% equity (4-year vest)
• CTO title and full technical control
• Remote, flexible hours
• Ground floor of potentially huge market

Tech stack: Python, Flask, gevent, Claude API

This is early-stage, so there's risk. But the upside is significant:
• $2M valuation = $400K equity
• $10M valuation = $2M equity
• $50M exit = $10M equity

Would you be open to a 30-minute call to discuss?

Even if not interested, I'd value your feedback on the technical approach.

Business Plan: [link]

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Also recruiting senior developers for 1-2% equity if full co-founder role isn't right.
```
